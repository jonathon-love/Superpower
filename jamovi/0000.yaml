  Functions to perform simulations of ANOVA designs of up to three factors.
  Calculates the observed power and average observed effect size for all main
  effects and interactions in the ANOVA, and all simple comparisons between
  conditions. Includes functions for analytic power calculations and additional
  helper functions that compute effect sizes for ANOVA designs, observed error
  rates in the simulations, and functions to plot power curves.
